## Memory Tracing

There is no way to identify specifically in the code where a leak is occuring. We can validate if a memory leak is present and which functions or methods are producing the most allocations.

## GODEBUG

[http://dave.cheney.net/2015/11/29/a-whirlwind-tour-of-gos-runtime-environment-variables](Tour of Go's env variables)

To validate if a memory leak is truly occuring use the GODEBUG environmental variable. Setting gctrace=1 causes the garbage collector to emit a single line to standard error at each collection, summarizing the amount of memory collected and the length of the pause. Setting gctrace=2 emits the same summary but also repeats each collection. The format of this line is subject to change:

    export GODEBUG=gctrace=1

    gc # @#s #%: #+...+# ms clock, #+...+# ms cpu, #->#-># MB, # MB goal, # P

Where the fields are as follows:

    gc #        the GC number, incremented at each GC
    @#s         time in seconds since program start
    #%          percentage of time spent in GC since program start
    #+...+#     wall-clock/CPU times for the phases of the GC
    #->#-># MB  heap size at GC start, at GC end, and live heap
    # MB goal   goal heap size
    # P         number of processors used

In C++, a memory leak is memory you have lost a reference to.
In Go, a memory leak is memory you retain a reference to.

### Running a GODEBUG Trace

    go build
    GODEBUG=gctrace=1 ./memory_trace

    gc 1 @0.009s 1%: 0.059+0.17+0.005+0.24+0.12 ms clock, 0.17+0.17+0+0/0.36/0.067+0.38 ms cpu, 5->5->3 MB, 4 MB goal, 8 P
    gc 2 @0.017s 1%: 0.037+0.096+0.098+0.21+0.086 ms clock, 0.22+0.096+0+0.10/0.31/0.091+0.51 ms cpu, 8->8->7 MB, 7 MB goal, 8 P
    gc 3 @0.032s 1%: 0.020+0.16+0.007+0.25+0.090 ms clock, 0.14+0.16+0+0/0.20/0.27+0.63 ms cpu, 17->17->14 MB, 14 MB goal, 8 P
    gc 4 @0.066s 0%: 0.029+0.17+0.074+0.48+0.10 ms clock, 0.20+0.17+0+0/0.42/0.26+0.76 ms cpu, 35->35->29 MB, 29 MB goal, 8 P

## pprof heap

We can get detailed information about the heap using the pprof support. We can actually produce and compare different profiles to see differences in memory over time.

### Comparing Profiles

    Build and run the service:
        go build
        ./memory_trace

    Take a snapshot of the current heap profile:

		curl -s http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap > base.heap

    After some time, take another snapshot:

		curl -s http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap > current.heap

    Now compare both snapshots against the binary and get into the pprof tool:

		go tool pprof -inuse_objects -base base.heap /PATH_TO_BINARY/finding_leaks current.heap

### Running pprof Commands

Run the `top` command to see the functions allocating the most objects:

    (pprof) top
    3182575 of 3182575 total (  100%)
    Dropped 5 nodes (cum <= 15912)
          flat  flat%   sum%        cum   cum%
       3182575   100%   100%    3182575   100%  main.main.func1
             0     0%   100%    3182575   100%  runtime.goexit

Run the `list` command against the goroutine declared in main:

    (pprof) list main.main.func1
    Total: 3182575
    ROUTINE ======================== main.main.func1 in /PATH_TO_BINARY/finding_leaks/leak.go
       3182575    3182575 (flat, cum)   100% of Total

             .          .     16:		}
             .          .     17:	}()
             .          .     18:
