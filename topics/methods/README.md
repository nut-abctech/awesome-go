## Methods

Methods are functions that are declared with a receiver which binds the method to a type. Then the method and can be used to operate on values or pointers of that type.

## Notes

* Methods are functions that contain a receiver value.
* Receivers bind a method to a type and can be value or pointers.
* Methods are called against values and pointers, not packages.
* Go support function and method variables.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Declare a struct that represents a baseball player. Include name, atBats and hits. Declare a method that calculates a players batting average. The formula is Hits / AtBats. Declare a slice of this type and initialize the slice with several players. Iterate over the slice displaying the players name and batting average.
