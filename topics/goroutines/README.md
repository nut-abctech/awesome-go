## Goroutines

Goroutines are functions that are created and scheduled to be run independently. Goroutines are multiplexed against a shared thread that is own by context. The scheduler is responsible for the management and execution of goroutines.

## Notes

* Goroutines are functions that are scheduled to run independently.
* The scheduler uses a context that owns an OS thread and goroutine run queue.
* We must always maintain an account of running goroutines and shutdown cleanly.
* Concurrency is not parallelism.
	* Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.
	* Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

**Part A** Create a program that declares two anonymous functions. Once that counts up to 100 from 0 and one that counts down to 0 from 100. Display each number with an unique identifier for each goroutine. Then create goroutines from these functions and don't let main return until the goroutines complete.

**Part B** Run the program in parallel.
